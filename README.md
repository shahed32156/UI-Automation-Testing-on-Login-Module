### 💼 Project Title

**UI Automation Testing** on **Login UI** of **OrangeHRM** website using **Selenium Webdriver**.

### 📝 Project Description

This project demonstrates **UI Automation Testing** of the Login Page of the [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) website using **Selenium WebDriver**.

The objective of this project is to validate the functionality and error-handling behavior of the login interface. 

By implementing automated test cases, this project ensures that the login module performs accurately across different scenarios, such as **valid credentials**, **invalid inputs**, **empty fields**, and **edge conditions**. The test automation helps in achieving faster regression testing, improved accuracy, and better maintainability of the testing process.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

| **Technology**                  | **Purpose**                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Java**                    | Programming language for test scripts      |
| **Selenium WebDriver**      | UI automation and browser assertions        |
| **Maven**                   | Build automation and dependency management |
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | Design pattern for better maintainability  |

### 🔎 Observations

- Total Test Case: 6
- Total Test Data: 12
- Passed Test Case: 5
- Failed Test Case: 1 (Must be fix)
- Error Rate (%): (1/6)*100 = 16.67%

### 🏁 Conclusion

The **UI Automation Testing on the Login UI of the OrangeHRM website** successfully verifies the reliability and functionality of the login module. By using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java** and the **Page Object Model (POM)** structure, the testing process became more efficient, maintainable, and reusable. 

The project ensures that the login interface performs accurately under various scenarios such as valid, invalid, and empty input conditions and if any defect or bug arise, developer will fix it. Through automated testing, manual effort is reduced, testing speed is increased, and overall product quality is improved.

This automation framework lays a strong foundation for extending test coverage to other modules of OrangeHRM and for integrating with CI/CD pipelines in future enhancements.
