**Automation Testing:** Automation testing is a type of software testing where test cases are executed automatically using tools or scripts, rather than being performed manually by a human tester.

**Selenium:** Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers, and the Chrome WebDriver is a part of Selenium that allows you to automate interactions with the Google Chrome web browser. With the Chrome WebDriver, you can write scripts in various programming languages to control Chrome's behavior, navigate web pages, interact with elements on a web page, and perform various testing and web scraping tasks.

**Selenium Chrome WebDriver:** In Java, you can use Selenium WebDriver to automate Google Chrome just like in other programming languages.

Here's a basic overview of **how to use Selenium Chrome WebDriver** in Java:

- Set Up Your Development Environment
- Create a Java Project
- Add Selenium WebDriver to Your Project
- Write Your Selenium Script
- Run Your Selenium Test
- Cleanup

**Login module URL of the "OrangeHRM" website:** https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login

I performed automation testing on the login module of the "OrangeHRM" website using Selenium with Java. I wrote 12 test values for this purposeâ€”each test case contains 2 test values (a username and a password), resulting in a total of 6 test cases. After executing the project, 5 test cases passed and test case number 3 failed.
